# Framingham_demo
Demonstration of a python implementation of the algorithm for calculating Framingham Risk Scores for cardiovascular disease

Execution runs a demonstration of how the algorithm is calculated, allows for entry of new data, and demonstrates some uses of the Framingham scores in analyses of fake data. 

The scorer and weight assignment functions are sufficiently generic that with a little bit of tinkering they can run in real data that has beeen properly named and cleaned up. 

The framingham scores are calculated based on scoring guidelines from:
